# EATME

I'm lazy and couldn't be bothered to write a proper readme yet, but I wanted
to share the current state of the code, so it doesn't start to rot on my disk
while I'm busy doing actual work.

Let this be said:

The code here has purely been [written to prove a point](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4miM_sZU-k),
and mostly for the joke of it.

If you see this and immediately want to use it for anything practical, you
are probably certifiable (and I don't mean in the Cisco CCNx sense).
